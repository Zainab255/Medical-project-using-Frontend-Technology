                      <p class="fst-italic">Laparoscopic surgery is a category of general surgeries that use laparoscopes to perform minimally invasive surgeries in Nashville, Tennessee. As mentioned earlier, exploratory laparotomy can be performed with a laparoscope. Additionally, our surgeons use laparoscopic techniques to improve appendectomies, gallbladder removal, colon surgery, hernia repairs, and GERD repairs through Nissen Fundoplication.</p>

                      <h3>LIPOMA:</h3>
                      <p>A lipoma is a lump of fat cells that forms under the skin and causes a visual bulge on the exterior of the skin. Lipomas can be mistaken for cancerous growths, but they are not cancerous nor harmful. Some may cause pain if they form above a nerve. If you want a lipoma removed it can be done through excision surgery from a general surgeon or one of our board-certified plastic surgeons in Nashville.</p>
                      <h3>Spine Surgery:</h3>
                      <p>Spine surgeries address conditions like herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and spinal deformities. Procedures range from minimally invasive techniques for nerve decompression to complex spinal fusion surgeries for stabilization.</p>
                      <h3>Colon and kidney:</h3>
                      <p>In certain advanced laparoscopic procedures, where the specimen removed is too large to pull through a trocar site (as is done with gallbladders), an incision larger than 10 mm must be made. The most common of these procedures are removal of all or part of the colon (colectomy), or removal of the kidney (nephrectomy). Some surgeons perform these procedures completely laparoscopically, making the larger incision toward the end of the procedure for specimen removal, or, in the case of a colectomy, to also prepare the remaining healthy bowel to be reconnected (create an anastomosis). Many other surgeons feel that since they will have to make a larger incision for specimen removal anyway, they might as well use this incision to have their hand in the operative field during the procedure to aid as a retractor, dissector, and to be able to feel differing tissue densities (palpate), as they would in open surgery. This technique is called hand-assist laparoscopy. Since they will still be working with scopes and other laparoscopic instruments, CO2 will have to be maintained in the patient's abdomen, so a device known as a hand access port (a sleeve with a seal that allows passage of the hand) must be used. Surgeons who choose this hand-assist technique feel it reduces operative time significantly versus the straight laparoscopic approach. It also gives them more options in dealing with unexpected adverse events (e.g., uncontrolled bleeding) that may otherwise require creating a much larger incision and converting to a fully open surgical procedure.[6]
    
                        Conceptually, the laparoscopic approach is intended to minimise post-operative pain and speed up recovery times, while maintaining an enhanced visual field for surgeons. Due to improved patient outcomes, in the last two decades, laparoscopic surgery has been adopted by various surgical sub-specialties, including gastrointestinal surgery (including bariatric procedures for morbid obesity), gynecologic surgery, and urology. Based on numerous prospective randomized controlled trials, the approach has proven to be beneficial in reducing post-operative morbidities such as wound infections and incisional hernias (especially in morbidly obese patients), and is now deemed safe when applied to surgery for cancers such as cancer of colon.[7][8]
                        
                        
                        Laparoscopic instruments
                        The restricted vision, the difficulty in handling of the instruments (new hand-eye coordination skills are needed), the lack of tactile perception, and the limited working area are factors adding to the technical complexity of this surgical approach. For these reasons, minimally invasive surgery has emerged as a highly competitive new sub-specialty within various fields of surgery. Surgical residents who wish to focus on this area of surgery gain additional laparoscopic surgery training during one or two years of fellowship after completing their basic surgical residency. In OB-GYN residency programs, the average laparoscopy-to-laparotomy quotient (LPQ) is 0.55.</p>

                      <h3>LIVER SURGERY</h3>
                      <p class="fst-italic">At The Surgical Clinic, we treat liver cancer and liver disease through liver resectioning surgery. The earlier the disease is detected, the better the patients chances for successful treatment and recovery. The liver is a vital organ, but it can still function if the diseased sections are removed and the rest of the liver is healthy.
    
                        Consult with your doctor and your surgeon to find out if this surgery is the right treatment for you.</p>

                      <h3>Fetal blood supply:</h3>
                      <p>In the growing fetus, a major source of blood to the liver is the umbilical vein, which supplies nutrients to the growing fetus. The umbilical vein enters the abdomen at the umbilicus and passes upward along the free margin of the falciform ligament of the liver to the inferior surface of the liver. There, it joins with the left branch of the portal vein. The ductus venosus carries blood from the left portal vein to the left hepatic vein and then to the inferior vena cava, allowing placental blood to bypass the liver. In the fetus, the liver does not perform the normal digestive processes and filtration of the infant liver because nutrients are received directly from the mother via the placenta. The fetal liver releases some blood stem cells that migrate to the fetal thymus, creating the T cells (or T lymphocytes). After birth, the formation of blood stem cells shifts to the red bone marrow. After 2–5 days, the umbilical vein and ductus venosus are obliterated; the former becomes the round ligament of liver and the latter becomes the ligamentum venosum. In the disorders of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, the umbilical vein can open up again.</p>
                      <h3>Metabolism:</h3>
                      <p>The liver plays a major role in carbohydrate, protein, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.</p>
                      <h3>Biliary flow:</h3>
                      <p>The biliary tract is derived from the branches of the bile ducts. The biliary tract, also known as the biliary tree, is the path by which bile is secreted by the liver then transported to the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. The bile produced in the liver is collected in bile canaliculi, small grooves between the faces of adjacent hepatocytes. The canaliculi radiate to the edge of the liver lobule, where they merge to form bile ducts. Within the liver, these ducts are termed intrahepatic bile ducts, and once they exit the liver, they are considered extrahepatic. The intrahepatic ducts eventually drain into the right and left hepatic ducts, which exit the liver at the transverse fissure, and merge to form the common hepatic duct. The cystic duct from the gallbladder joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.[41] The biliary system and connective tissue is supplied by the hepatic artery alone.
    
                        Bile either drains directly into the duodenum via the common bile duct, or is temporarily stored in the gallbladder via the cystic duct. The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct enter the second part of the duodenum together at the hepatopancreatic ampulla, also known as the ampulla of Vater.</p>

                      <h3>Dental anesthesia</h3>
                      <p class="fst-italic">Dentists inject anesthetic to block sensory transmission by the alveolar nerves. The superior alveolar nerves are not usually anesthetized directly because they are difficult to approach with a needle. For this reason, the maxillary teeth are usually anesthetized locally by inserting the needle beneath the oral mucosa surrounding the teeth. The inferior alveolar nerve is probably anesthetized more often than any other nerve in the body. To anesthetize this nerve, the dentist inserts the needle somewhat beyond the patient's last molar.</p>

                      <h3>Orthodontic treatment:</h3>
                      <p>Implants and implant-supported prosthesis  also an orthodontic treatment as it involves bones
                        Apicoectomy  also an orthodontic treatment as part of the underlying bone structure must be removed
                        Extraction  a procedure in which a diseased, redundant, or problematic tooth is removed, either by pulling or cutting out. This procedure can be done under local or general anesthesia and is very common  many people have their wisdom teeth removed before they become problematic.
                        Fiberotomy  a procedure to sever the fibers around a tooth, preventing it from relapsing</p>
                      <h3>Endodontic:</h3>
                      <p>Root canal treatment
                        Pulpotomy the opening of the pulp chamber of the tooth to allow an infection to drain; usually a precursor to a root canal
                        Pulpectomy the removal of the pulp from the pulp chamber to temporarily relieve pain; usually a precursor to a root canal
                        Apicoectomy a root end resection. Occasionally a root canal alone is enough to relieve pain and the end of the tooth, called the apex, is removed by entering through the gingiva and surgically extracting the diseased material.</p>
                        <h3>Prosthodontics:</h3>
                        <p>Crown
                          (caps) — artificial covering of a tooth made from a variety of biocompatible materials, including CMC/PMC (ceramic/porcelain metal composite), gold or a tin/aluminum mixture. The underlying tooth must be reshaped to accommodate these fixed restorations</p><br>
                          <p>Veneers — artificial coverings similar to above, except that they only cover the forward (labial or buccal) surface of the tooth. Usually for aesthetic purposes only.</p>
